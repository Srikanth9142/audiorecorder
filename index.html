    <p>My name is Alex Roy. I'm from Boston where I did my schooling. Since my childhood, I've been very interested in computers. So I chose to study Computer Science and Engineering at the North-Eastern University. I'm a good student. I like all subjects of computer science but Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are my favorite subjects. I'm creative and love to solve challenging technical problems. I hope to work for an innovative company such as yours where I get the opportunity to learn new technologies and implement them to create products for the benefit of the company and society.
